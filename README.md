RRCS is a great tool for interfacing with the Artist system, but It doesn't come with any friendly out-of-the-box tools for submitting commands.
Sometimes you want to limit an operators access to the system by provifing a cutomised interface, simplifed and tailored to their requiments.

This is that interface.
